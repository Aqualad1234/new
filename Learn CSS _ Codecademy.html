	<h1>Introduction>
	<p>NBA fans have gotten used to LeBron James being at the pinnacle of the basketball world, but eventually, we’ll all witness his fall from grace. He’s the best basketball player in the world. There’s no disputing that. Regardless of where your loyalty lies, you can’t deny that his combination of athleticism, passing, scoring and basketball IQ is unrivaled.
	He grew up in Akron,Ohio without a father and played football then turning over to basketball. He is a 37 year old who still plays at the highest level.</p>
		<h2> Prime 1:The beginning</h2>
	<p>Let’s be honest, LeBron James has had nearly three different primes in his 15-year career. He had an amazing 2002-03 season, earning Rookie of the Year honors. However, his first prime probably began during his second year in the NBA. This might sound crazy, but he had ridiculous levels of production from this year forward.

In his sophomore season, LeBron averaged 27.2 points, 7.4 rebounds and 7.2 assists. He logged over 40 minutes a game from year two through year five. James was named the MVP of the league in 2009, after his sixth season. He was an explosive, above the rim scorer that didn’t even need a consistent jump shot to be successful.
His first stretch in Cleveland was the only time in his career where he averaged over 30 points in the regular season. In 2010, James was named MVP for the second consecutive season. However, this marked the end of his seven year streak as a Cavalier. It was time for the next chapter in his journey.
