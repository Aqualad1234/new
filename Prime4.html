  <h1>The Last Chapter</h1>
   <p>LeBron James will most likely finish out his career as a Laker.
   He has endless business opportunities, the ability to become a creative producer and an environment he feels will be good to his family. 
   It looks like he’s already preparing for life after basketball.
    The Western Conference is tough, but it’s unlikely James would’ve joined up if he didn’t believe he could lead the team effectively. 
    After all, he did the same thing in Cleveland.
Before it’s all said and done, LeBron wants to be considered the best player to ever lace up a pair of kicks. 
   Michael Jordan managed average 20 points until age 40, so LeBron could probably do the same.
    When James contract is up, he’ll be a 37-year-old. year twenty will be right around the corner. 
    Even if he loses some athleticism, his size and knowledge of the game will allow him to play at an elite level. 
    Realistically, James’ prime will probably end in the next three to four years.
Kevin Durant, Anthony Davis and Giannis Antetokounmpo are just a few of the players looking to dethrone him. 
   Everyone’s prime ends at some point, but James will still be an All-Star when his comes to a close.
    His love for the game and dedication to his craft earned him the Best NBA Player Award at the ESPY’s in seven of the past 12 years. 
    Even in his decline, he’ll help guide the next generation of NBA superstars. 
    Which is true as many players from the 2010's era of the Nba draft have openly said multiple times they look up to Lebron James or try to model their game around his. 
    Which proves how dominant and good for the league and the world he is and has been for the past years and years to come. </p>
