  <h1> Prime 3:The Return<h1>
   <p>The prodigal son returned to Cleveland after his Heat lost to the San Antonio Spurs in the 2014 NBA Finals. 
     LeBron was closing in on 30 and wanted to bring a trophy to his home state of Ohio. 
     People speculated that James would begin to slow down in the years to come because of how he was aging but that wasn't the case.
     The Cavs didn’t make the playoffs the previous year, but they did have a promising young guard in Kyrie Irving. That was more than what James had to work with last time around. However, the trade to acquire Kevin Love from the Minnesota Timberwolves changed everything. 
     The Cavs tripled their All-Star count in less than a year. James went on to lead the Cavs to their first ever NBA championship in 2016. Their historic recovery from a 3-1 deficit to the Golden State Warriors will go down in history.
James has lost to the Warriors in the NBA in three of his last four seasons. Even after the departure of Kyrie Irving, he continued to flourish in Cleveland. The 8.6 rebounds he averaged last season tied a career high. Meanwhile, the 9.1 assists he dished out surpassed his previous high of 8.7
     Many felt James should’ve received more consideration for MVP, but voters seem to have grown tired of the king’s reign.</p>
