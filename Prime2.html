  <h1> Prime 2:The Departure</h1>
  <p>Jamesâ€™ second prime began after his highly publicized decision to join the Miami Heat. He was always the one his team had to score during critical moments in the game. Therefore, he was almost always on the court. A big part of his transition to Miami was the introduction of strategic rest.
Teaming up with two All-Stars like Dwayne Wade and Chris Bosh allowed him to accept a slight dip in his minutes throughout the regular season. This way, he had fresh legs for the playoffs. This strategy followed him when he returned to Cleveland. James won back to back MVP Awards during his second and third seasons in Miami. He also won two championships in four years.
He was never a great three-point shooter, but he learned to be selective. His number of midrange shots and makes decreased, but he scored more in the restricted area. The 40.6 percent mark from deep he reached in in 2013 is a career high to this day. James had been a cerebral player, but his analysis of his game and those around him ascended to another level.
He was a absolute powerhouse in those years in Miami he had in my opinion a top 3 season of his career there from 2012-2013 putting everyone on the map that he was the best.
